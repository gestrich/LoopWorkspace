#  Caregiver App

## Clone Repo

* Xcode version 14 or greater required
* Run the following command to clone the repo to a new directory named "LoopCaregiver" (The directory will be created for you)
```
git clone --branch=dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopCaregiver LoopCaregiver

```
* Open the workspace in Xcode
   * Continue in your current terminal with these commands
```
cd LoopCaregiver
xed .

```
* Select the "LoopCaregiver" project on the left
* Select Signing and Capabilities and select your "team", like you would for Loop
* Select the LoopCaregiver target up top instead of Loop (Workspace) and select your iPhone
* Make sure dependencies have finished
* Build + Run

## Update Repo

* You need to update the repo to get the last bug fixes and features.
* You need to be in a terminal in the LoopCaregiver folder you created earlier and use these commands

```
git stash
git pull --recurse-submodules

```

This may show some `Fetching` lines and end in a message that includes:


`Fast-forward`

` # files changed, # insertions(+), # deletions(-)`

or

`
Already up to date.
`

In either case, to build:

```
git stash pop
xed .

```

If the `git stash pop` gives an error, you'll have to sign the targets again. If it succeeds, you can just build.

Remote Commands 2 is a set of features that supports remote command status end helps with the limitaitons of push notifications. This feature is very early in development and subject to change quickly.

This is a work-in-progress and is only suggested for advanced Loop builders that are comfortable troubleshooting git and Xcode issues and deploying to Nightscout. 

* Deploy special caregiver branch of Nightscout: https://github.com/gestrich/cgm-remote-monitor/tree/caregiver 
  * Make sure to deploy the "caregiver" branch
* Build special caregiver branch of LoopWorkspace which is based https://github.com/gestrich/LoopWorkspace/tree/caregiver
  * This branch is based on the Loop 3.0 branch (not Loop dev) + remote command additions.
  * Make sure to build the "caregiver" branch
* Activate Remote Commands 2 switch in Caregiver -> Settings 
* After delivering carbs/bolus/override, the command status will show at the bottom of Caregiver Settings -> Select Loopers name.
* Additional commands such as autobolus activation, closed loop activation are available in aforementioned view.
